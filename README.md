# Demo
This page is meant to serve as a portfolio of web dev work.  It was begun in February 2023 as a replacement for an older portfolio site built when I had far less experience.

# Motivation
I'd had a portfolio site that was started in college and updated periodically, but it no longer reflected my experience and knowledge.  This portfolio goes beyond "I know how to write code" to demonstrate a full engineering workflow including full-stack developing, unit testing, CI/CD, everything beyond coding that goes into engineering.

### Stack
 - Frontend: Typescript - React - Material UI
 - Backend: Typescript - NodeJS
 - Testing: Jest - Enzyme
 - CI/CD: CircleCI - Github - Heroku
